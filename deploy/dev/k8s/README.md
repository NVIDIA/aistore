## Introduction

[Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs) allows one to run Kubernetes locally (like on your laptop) thus providing for testing out applications in a native Kubernetes environment.

* [Minikube GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube)

Minikube can only be used for a single-node Kubernetes cluster. It supports a range of drivers like Virtualbox, KVM, Docker, etc.

Virtualbox and KVM require a hypervisor. However, if you choose to use docker on a Linux machine there is no need for a hypervisor.

Our [scripts](/deploy/dev/k8s) use Docker as the driver. This document shows how to deploy AIStore on minikube and use it for some of its features like ETL(transformers) etc. or to develop new features on it.

## Prerequisites

1. Have Linux/macOS installed on your Laptop/Machine/VirtualMachine.
2. [Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) Docker.
3. Ensure that your `$USER` is added to the `docker` group.

```console
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
```
4. Install [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).
5. Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

**Notes:**
- Running minikube on a VPN might be problematic. For smoother operations, try running with VPN disabled. More information can be found [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/vpn_and_proxy/).
- Running minikube with the Docker driver on newer macOS versions may encounter problems. Please refer to the [known issues](#known-issues) section for more details.

All commands below are running from the same directory i.e `${AISTORE_ROOT}/deploy/dev/k8s`

## [Makefile](/deploy/dev/k8s/Makefile)

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `make try` | start minikube and run a basic version of AIStore inside it ([ref](#trying-aistore-on-minikube)) |
| `make dev` | deploy multi-proxy/target AIStore with other utilities ([ref](#developing-aistore-on-minikube)) |
| `make minimal` | start a minimal AIStore deployment (1 proxy and 1 target) on an already running minikube |
| `make redeploy-ais` | skips the minikube and Docker registry deployment in `make dev` |
| `make minimal-local` | start minikube, rebuild the `aisnode` container with local changes and start a minimal deployment |
| `make redeploy-local` | rebuild the `aisnode` container with local changes on an already running minikube |
| `make stop-ais` | stop running AIStore pods  |
| `make stop`| stop and deletes AIStore pods, minikube cluster |

## Trying AIStore on minikube

### Deploy

You can start minikube with a basic version of AIStore (1-proxy and 1-target) running inside of it with the `make try` command.

```console
$ # navigate to this directory
$ # cd ${AISTORE_ROOT}/deploy/dev/k8s
$
$ make try
$
$ # you can also set the CPU and MEMORY allocated to minikube by
$ CPU=8 MEMORY=16000 make -e try
```


### Stopping and cleanup
To stop AIS nodes running inside of minikube, deleting all the pods and minikube itself, you can run the `stop` target of the [Makefile](/deploy/dev/k8s/Makefile).

```console
$ make stop
```

### Enabling HTTPS in Minikube for AIStore Deployment

To enable HTTPS for your AIStore deployment in Minikube, follow these steps:
#### For Minimal Deployment

To set up a minimal AIStore deployment with HTTPS, run the following command:

```bash
$ HTTPS=true make try
```

#### For Development Deployment

For a development deployment, follow these steps:

1. Run the `make dev` command:

```bash
$ make dev
```

2. During the setup process, you will be prompted to enable HTTPS. Respond with "y" to activate HTTPS:

```bash
Enable HTTPS: (y/n)?
y
```

With these steps, your Minikube-based AIStore deployment will be configured for secure HTTPS communication.

#### Testing Considerations for HTTPS

When working with HTTPS-enabled AIStore deployments, here are some important testing considerations:

#### 1. AIStore CLI Configuration

If you're using the AIStore CLI for testing, set the following environment variable to bypass certificate verification and connect to the AIStore cluster:

```bash
$ ais config cli set cluster.skip_verify_crt true
```

#### 2. Using `curl`

When interacting with your AIStore cluster over HTTPS using `curl`, use the `-k` flag to skip certificate validation:

```bash
$ curl -k https://your-ais-cluster-url
```

#### 3. Exporting the Self-Signed Certificate

If you prefer not to skip certificate validation when using `curl`, you can export the self-signed certificate for use:

```bash
$ kubectl get secret ais-tls-certs -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 --decode > tls.crt
```

Now, you can use the exported `tls.crt` as a parameter when using `curl`, like this:

```bash
$ curl --cacert tls.crt https://your-ais-cluster-url
```

## Developing AIStore on minikube


### Deploy

The `dev` target of [Makefile](/deploy/dev/k8s/Makefile) allows you to customize and run AIStore by accepting inputs from the user through the terminal.

```console
$ make redeploy-ais
```

To update the aisnode images, or to redeploy AIStore, execute the `make ais-redeploy` argument, as shown below. This will skip the minikube and Docker registry deployment.

### Local

By default, the make targets will pull the `aisnode-minikube` image from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/aistorage/). The `minimal-local` and `redeploy-local` options provide an easy way to test changes on a minimal cluster with a rebuilt local image by pushing the image to the local minikube registry. `make dev` also includes a prompt to rebuild the local image for more complex deployments.  

### Stopping and cleanup

The `stop-ais` target stops the AIStore cluster while keeping minikube still running.

```console
$ make stop-ais
```

For stopping and deleting the minikube cluster

```console
$ make stop
```

NOTE: If the default jupyter local directory was overwritten while deploying, ensure `JUPYTER_LOCAL_DIR` is pointing to the correct directory when performing a cleanup.

## Known Issues

See [known issues](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/docker/#known-issues) with using Docker driver.

**macOS only:** One of the scripts to start AIS uses the `envsubst` command, which is not available by default. Please run the following commands as a workaround:
```
brew install gettext
brew link --force gettext
```
The ingress, and ingress-dns addons are currently only supported on Linux. See [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/7332).
