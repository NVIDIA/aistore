# Python Tests

This directory contains unit tests and integration tests for each of the python packages we provide.
It also contains tests for verifying s3 compatibility.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, install Python and set up your environment (venv, pyenv, conda, etc.). 
The below instructions assume `python` will execute the correct version of Python. 

Next, with your environment active, from the `aistore/python` directory install the dependencies for the tests you want 
to run:

For all packages:

`pip install -r aistore/common_requirements`

For botocore patch tests:

`pip install -r aistore/botocore_patch/botocore_requirements`

For pytorch tests:

`pip install -r aistore/pytorch/dev_requirements`

## Integration tests

### Cluster

Integration tests require a running AIS cluster. 
This can be specified with the environment variable `AIS ENDPOINT` or will default to http://localhost:8080. 

### ETL

Note that any tests of etl functionality require the AIS cluster to be running in kubernetes. 
These tests can be skipped using the pytest ignore option, e.g. `--ignore=tests/integration/sdk/test_etl_ops.py`

### Remote buckets

To run tests that expect a remote bucket, e.g. testing eviction of an object stored in s3, the `BUCKET`
environment variable must be set; otherwise these tests will be skipped. 

---

## Running the tests

All tests should support running on all operating systems, given access to a working AIS cluster. 

Because of the way our botocore patch works, simply running pytest on the entire test directory will fail those tests. See the [botocore test README](python/tests/unit/botocore_patch/README.md) for more info

Below are the recommended commands for running the test suites. Run these commands from the aistore/python directory. 

---

### SDK tests:

`python -m pytest tests/unit/sdk tests/integration/sdk`


#### Excluding ETL (ETL requires AIS cluster running on k8s)

`python -m pytest tests/unit/sdk tests/integration/sdk --ignore=tests/integration/sdk/test_etl_ops.py`


#### Integration only

`python -m pytest tests/integration/sdk`

#### Unit only

`python -m pytest tests/unit/sdk`

---

### Botocore patch

#### Unit tests
1.  Set the variable for number of tests
    ##### Windows (Powershell): 
        $BOTO_UNIT_TEST_COUNT = Get-ChildItem -Path "tests/unit/botocore_patch" -Filter "test*.py" | Measure-Object | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Count
    ##### Unix:
        BOTO_UNIT_TEST_COUNT=$(ls -1 tests/unit/botocore_patch/test*py | wc -l)
2.  Run pytest with the xdist plugin to ensure each test runs separately

    `python -m pytest -v -n $BOTO_UNIT_TEST_COUNT --dist loadfile tests/unit/botocore_patch/`

#### Integration tests

    python -m pytest tests/integration/botocore_patch

---

### Pytorch

    python -m pytest tests/integration/pytorch

---

### S3 compatibility

Currently, we have 2 separate tests for AIS S3 compatibility.

#### Custom s3 tests

There is our own suite of tests, located in tests/integration/boto3. It can be run with

    python -m pytest -v tests/integration/boto3 


#### Minio s3 tests

`s3compat` contains a modified version of the s3 tests from the Minio Python SDK, see the [README](s3compat/README.md) for details.
