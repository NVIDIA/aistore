## AIS Python SDK

AIS Python SDK provides a (growing) set of client-side APIs to access and utilize AIS clusters, buckets, and objects.

The project is, essentially, a Python port of the [AIS Go APIs](https://aiatscale.org/docs/http-api), with additional objectives that prioritize *utmost convenience for Python developers*.

Note that only Python 3.x (version 3.6 or later) is currently supported.


## Installation


### Install as a Package

The latest AIS release can be easily installed either with Anaconda or `pip`:

```console
$ conda install aistore
```

```console
$ pip install aistore
```


### Install From Source

If you'd like to work with the current upstream (and don't mind the risk), install the latest master directly from GitHub:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore.git

$ cd aistore/python/

$ pip install -e .
```


## Quick Start

In order to interact with your running AIS instance, you will need to create a `client` object:

```python
from aistore.sdk import Client

client = Client("http://localhost:8080")
```

The newly created `client` object can be used to interact with your AIS cluster, buckets, and objects. Here are a few ways to do so:

```python
# Check if AIS is deployed and running
client.cluster().is_aistore_running()
```

```python
# Get cluster information
client.cluster().get_info()
```

```python
# Create a bucket named "my-ais-bucket"
client.bucket("my-ais-bucket").create()
```

```python
# Delete bucket named "my-ais-bucket"
client.bucket("my-ais-bucket").delete()
```

```python
# Head bucket
client.bucket("my-ais-bucket").head()
```

```python
# Head object
client.bucket("my-ais-bucket").object("my-object").head()
```

```python
# Put Object
client.bucket("my-ais-bucket").object("my-new-object").put("path-to-object")
```

> If you are using AIS buckets, you can simply omit the provider argument (defaults to ProviderAIS) when instantiating a bucket object (`client.bucket("my-ais-bucket").create()` is equivalent to `client.bucket("my-ais-bucket", provider="ais").create()`).

**Working with multiple objects**

AIS supports multi-object operations on groups of objects. An `ObjectGroup` can be created with one of:
* a list of object names
* an [ObjectRange](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/python/aistore/object_range.py)
* a string template.


```python
# Create Object Group by list of names
my_objects = client.bucket("my-ais-bucket").objects(obj_names=["my-obj-1", "my-obj-2", "my-obj-3"])
```

```python
# Create Object Group by ObjectRange
my_object_range = ObjectRange(prefix="my-obj", min_index="1", max_index="3")
my_objects = client.bucket("my-ais-bucket").objects(obj_range=my_object_range)
```

String templates can be passed directly to AIS following the [syntax described here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/docs/batch.md#operations-on-multiple-selected-objects)
```python
# Create Object Group by Template String
my_object_template = "my-obj-{1..3}"
my_objects = client.bucket("my-ais-bucket").objects(obj_template=my_object_template)
# More advanced template example with multiple ranges and defined steps
complex_range = "my-obj-{0..10..2}-details-{1..9..2}-.file-extension"
```

```python
# Delete Multiple Objects
my_objects.delete()
```

```python
# Evict Multiple Objects
my_objects.evict()
```

```python
# Prefetch Multiple Objects
my_objects.prefetch()
```

**External Cloud Storage Buckets**

AIS supports a number of different [backend providers](https://aiatscale.org/docs/providers) or, simply, backends.

> For exact definitions and related capabilities, please see [terminology](https://aiatscale.org//docs/overview#terminology).

Many bucket/object operations support remote cloud buckets (third-party backend-based cloud buckets), including a few of the operations shown above. To interact with remote cloud buckets, you need to *specify the provider* of choice when instantiating your bucket object as follows:

```python
# Head AWS bucket
client.bucket("my-aws-bucket", provider="aws").head()
```

```python
# Evict GCP bucket
client.bucket("my-gcp-bucket", provider="gcp").evict()
```

```python
# Get object from Azure bucket
client.bucket("my-azure-bucket", provider="azure").object("filename.ext").get()
```

```python
# List objects in AWS bucket'
client.bucket("my-aws-bucket", provider="aws").list_objects()
```

Please note that certain operations do **not** support external cloud storage buckets. Please refer to the [API reference documentation](https://aiatscale.org/docs/python_api.md) for more information on which bucket/object operations support remote cloud buckets, as well as general information on class and method usage.


### ETLs

AIStore also supports [ETLs](https://aiatscale.org/docs/etl), short for Extract-Transform-Load. ETLs with AIS are beneficial given that the transformations occur *locally*, which largely contributes to the linear scalability of AIS.

> Note: AIS-ETL requires [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). For more information on deploying AIStore with Kubernetes (or Minikube), refer [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/deploy/dev/k8s/README.md).

The following example is a sample workflow involing AIS-ETL.

We can initialize ETLs with either [code](https://aiatscale.org/docs/etl#init-code-request) or [spec](https://aiatscale.org/docs/etl#init-spec-request).

We initialize an ETL w/ [code](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/docs/etl.md#init-code-request):

```python
import hashlib

# Defining ETL transformation code
def transform(input_bytes):
    md5 = hashlib.md5()
    md5.update(input_bytes)
    return md5.hexdigest().encode()

# Initializing ETL  with transform()
client.etl().init_code(transform=transform, etl_id="etl-code")
```

We initialize another ETL w/ [spec](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/docs/etl.md#init-spec-request):

```python
from aistore.sdk.etl_templates import MD5

template = MD5.format(communication_type="hpush")
client.etl().init_spec(template=template, etl_id="etl-spec")
```

> Refer to more ETL templates [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/python/aistore/sdk/etl_templates.py).

Once initialized, we can verify the ETLs are running with method `list()`:

```python
# List all running ETLs
client.etl().list()
```

We can get an object with the ETL transformations applied:

```python
# Get object w/ ETL code transformation
obj1 = client.bucket("bucket-demo").object("object-demo").get(etl_id="etl-code").read_all()

# Get object w/ ETL spec transformation
obj2 = client.bucket("bucket-demo").object("object-demo").get(etl_id="etl-spec").read_all()
```

Alternatively, we can transform an entire bucket's contents as follows:

```python
# Transform bucket w/ ETL code transformation
client.bucket("bucket-demo").transform(etl_id="etl-code", to_bck="bucket-transformed")

# Transform bucket w/ ETL spec transformation
client.bucket("bucket-demo").transform(etl_id="etl-spec", to_bck="bucket-transformed")
```

Transform also allows for *on-the-fly* rename operations for objects:

```python
# Add a prefix to the resulting transformed files:
client.bucket("bucket-demo").transform(etl_id="etl-code", to_bck="bucket-transformed", prefix="transformed-")

# Replace existing filename extensions
client.bucket("bucket-demo").transform(etl_id="etl-spec", to_bck="bucket-transformed", ext={"jpg":"txt"})
```

We can stop the ETLs if desired with method `stop()`:

```python
# Stop ETL
client.etl().stop(etl_id="etl-code")
client.etl().stop(etl_id="etl-spec")

# Verify ETLs are not actively running
client.etl().list()
```

If an ETL is stopped, any Kubernetes pods created for the ETL are *stopped*, but *not deleted*. Any transforms by the stopped ETL are terminated. Stopped ETLs can be resumed for use with method `start()`:

```python
# Stop ETLs
client.etl().start(etl_id="etl-code")
client.etl().start(etl_id="etl-spec")

# Verify ETLs are not actively running
client.etl().list()
```

Once completely finished with the ETLs, we cleanup (for storage) by stopping the ETLs with `stop` and substenquently deleting the ETLs with `delete`:

```python
# Stop ETLs
client.etl().stop(etl_id="etl-code")
client.etl().stop(etl_id="etl-spec")

# Delete ETLs
client.etl().delete(etl_id="etl-code")
client.etl().delete(etl_id="etl-spec")

```

Deleting an ETL deletes all pods created by Kuberenetes for the ETL as well as any specifications for the ETL on Kubernetes. Consequently, deleted ETLs cannot be started again and will need to be re-initialized.

### PyTorch Integration

You can list and load data from AIS buckets (buckets that are not 3rd party backend-based) and remote cloud buckets (3rd party backend-based cloud buckets) in PyTorch using [AISFileLister](https://pytorch.org/data/main/generated/torchdata.datapipes.iter.AISFileLister.html#aisfilelister) and [AISFileLoader](https://pytorch.org/data/main/generated/torchdata.datapipes.iter.AISFileLoader.html#torchdata.datapipes.iter.AISFileLoader).

`AISFileLister` and `AISFileLoader` are now available as a part of official [pytorch/data](https://github.com/pytorch/data/blob/main/torchdata/datapipes/iter/load/aisio.py) project.

```python
from torchdata.datapipes.iter import AISFileLister, AISFileLoader

# provide list of prefixes to load and list data from
ais_prefixes = ['gcp://bucket-name/folder/', 'aws:bucket-name/folder/', 'ais://bucket-name/folder/', ...]

# List all files for these prefixes using AISFileLister
dp_ais_urls = AISFileLister(url='localhost:8080', source_datapipe=ais_prefixes)

# print(list(dp_ais_urls))

# Load files using AISFileLoader
dp_files = AISFileLoader(url='localhost:8080', source_datapipe=dp_ais_urls)

for url, file in dp_files:
    pass
```

### An Alternative: Using Boto3 (and botocore)
As an alternative to the [AIStore Python API](https://aiatscale.org/docs/python_api.md), you may prefer to use Amazon's popular [Boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3) library, or possibly [botocore](https://github.com/boto/botocore), which *boto3* uses under the hood.

By default, botocore doesn't handle [HTTP redirects](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#page-54), which prevents you from using it with AIStore.

To resolve this, install `aistore` with the `botocore` extra,  and then import `aistore.botocore_patch.botocore` in your code. This will monkey patch HTTP redirect support into botocore.

```shell
$ pip install aistore[botocore]
```

```python
import boto3
from aistore.botocore_patch import botocore
```
