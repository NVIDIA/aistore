<h2 id="highly-available-control-plane">Highly Available Control Plane</h2>

<p>AIStore cluster will survive a loss of any storage target and any gateway including the primary gateway (leader). New gateways and targets can join at any time – including the time of electing a new leader. Each new node joining a running cluster will get updated with the most current cluster-level metadata.
Failover – that is, the election of a new leader – is carried out automatically on failure of the current/previous leader. Failback on the hand – that is, administrative selection of the leading (likely, an originally designated) gateway – is done manually via AIStore <a href="/docs/http_api.md">HTTP API</a>.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, recommended that AIStore cluster is deployed with multiple proxies aka gateways (the terms that are interchangeably used throughout the source code and this README).</p>

<p>When there are multiple proxies, only one of them acts as the primary while all the rest are, respectively, non-primaries. The primary proxy’s (primary) responsibility is serializing updates of the cluster-level metadata (which is also versioned and immutable).</p>

<p>Further:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each proxy/gateway stores a local copy of the cluster map (Smap)</li>
  <li>Each Smap instance is immutable and versioned; the versioning is monotonic (increasing)</li>
  <li>Only the current primary (leader) proxy distributes Smap updates to all other clustered nodes</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h3>

<p>The proxy’s bootstrap sequence initiates by executing the following three main steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>step 1: load a local copy of the cluster map and try to use it for the discovery of the current one;</li>
  <li>step 2: use the local configuration and the local Smap to perform the discovery of the cluster-level metadata;</li>
  <li>step 3: use all of the above <em>and</em> the environment setting “AIS_PRIMARYPROXY” to figure out whether this proxy must keep starting up as a primary (otherwise, join as a non-primary).</li>
</ul>

<p>Further, the (potentially) primary proxy executes more steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(i)    initialize empty Smap;</li>
  <li>(ii)   wait a configured time for other nodes to join;</li>
  <li>(iii)  merge the Smap containing newly joined nodes with the Smap that was previously discovered;</li>
  <li>(iiii) and use the latter to rediscover cluster-wide metadata and resolve remaining conflicts, if any.</li>
</ul>

<p>If during any of these steps the proxy finds out that it must be joining as a non-primary then it simply does so.</p>

<h3 id="election">Election</h3>

<p>The primary proxy election process is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A candidate to replace the current (failed) primary is selected;</li>
  <li>The candidate is notified that an election is commencing;</li>
  <li>After the candidate (proxy) confirms that the current primary proxy is down, it broadcasts vote requests to all other nodes;</li>
  <li>Each recipient node confirms whether the current primary is down and whether the candidate proxy has the HRW (Highest Random Weight) according to the local Smap;</li>
  <li>If confirmed, the node responds with Yes, otherwise it’s a No;</li>
  <li>If and when the candidate receives a majority of affirmative responses it performs the commit phase of this two-phase process by distributing an updated cluster map to all nodes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="non-electable-gateways">Non-electable gateways</h3>

<p>AIStore cluster can be <em>stretched</em> to collocate its redundant gateways with the compute nodes. Those non-electable local gateways (<a href="/ais/setup/config.sh">AIStore configuration</a>) will only serve as access points but will never take on the responsibility of leading the cluster.</p>

<h3 id="metasync">Metasync</h3>

<p>By design, AIStore does not have a centralized (SPOF) shared cluster-level metadata. The metadata consists of versioned objects: cluster map, buckets (names and properties), authentication tokens. In AIStore, these objects are consistently replicated across the entire cluster – the component responsible for this is called <a href="/ais/metasync.go">metasync</a>. AIStore metasync makes sure to keep cluster-level metadata in-sync at all times.</p>
