## AIStore Open Source Contribution Requirements

All contributors must "sign-off" on each commit. This certifies that each contribution is that contributor's original work per the following Developer Certificate of Origin.

Commits that are not signed-off cannot be accepted or merged.

Commits can be signed off by using the `git` command's `--signoff` (or `-s`) option:

```bash
$ git commit -s -m "Add new feature"
```

This will append the following type of footer to the commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```
