# For (full) object downloads, we will read (up to) the first OCI_MULTI_PART_DOWNLOAD_THRESHOLD
# bytes of the object. Upon return, we will know the total object size. If there are more
# bytes to read, we will shift to MultiPartDownload ("MPD") mode and read (up to)
# OCI_MULTI_PART_DOWNLOAD_MAX_THREADS segments at a time each (up to)
# OCI_MAX_DOWNLOAD_SEGMENT_SIZE bytes until enough threads have covered the total
# object size.

# For object uploads, we will know up front the total object size. If that size is less than
# or equal to OCI_MULTI_PART_UPLOAD_THRESHOLD, we will simply perform a simple PUT upload.
# Otherwise, we will shift to MultiPartUpload ("MPD") mode and PUT segments of (up to)
# OCI_MAX_UPLOAD_SEGMENT_SIZE using (up to) OCI_MULTI_PART_UPLOAD_MAX_THREADS at a time
# until enough threads have covered the total object size.
