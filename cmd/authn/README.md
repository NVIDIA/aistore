## Overview

AIStore Authentication Server (AuthN) provides a token-based secure access to AIStore. It employs [JSON Web Tokens](https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go) framework to grant access to resources: buckets and objects. Please read a short [introduction to JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/) for details. Currently, we only support hash-based message authentication (HMAC) using SHA256 hash.

AuthN is a standalone server that manages users and tokens tokens. If AuthN is enabled on a cluster,
a client must request a token from AuthN and put it into HTTP headers of every request to the cluster.
Requests without tokens are rejected.

A typical workflow looks as follows:

AuthN generates self-sufficient tokens: a proxy does not need access to AuthN to check permissions.
Though, for security reasons, clusters should be registered at AuthN server.
When a user is deleted, all user's tokens that are still valid are revoked.
AuthN broadcasts revoked tokens to all registered clusters, so they updated their blacklists.
The same happens when an administrator manually revokes a compromised token.

A workflow for the case when a token is revoked manually and only one cluster is registered.
"AIS Cluster 2" is unregistered and allows requests with revoked token:

AuthN supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols. By default, AuthN starts as HTTP server listening on port 52001. If you enable HTTPS access make sure that the configuration file options `server_crt` and `server_key` point to the correct SSL certificate and key.


## Getting started

Environment variables used by the deployment script to setup AuthN server:

| Variable | Default value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| AIS_ENDPOINT | `""` | Primary proxy URL for AuthN to notify the cluster about events like a token is revoked |
| AIS_SECRET_KEY | `aBitLongSecretKey` | A secret key to encrypt and decrypt tokens |
| AUTH_ENABLED | `false` | Set it to `true` to enable AuthN server and token-based access in AIStore proxy |
| AUTHN_PORT | `52001` | Port on which AuthN listens to requests |
| AUTHN_TTL | `24h` | A token expiration time. Can be set to 0 that means "no expiration time" |

All variables can be set at AIStore launch. Example of starting AuthN with the default configuration:

```console
$ AUTH_ENABLED=true make deploy
```

Note: don't forget to change the default secret key used to encrypt and decrypt tokens before starting the deployment process.

To change AuthN settings after deployment, modify the server's configuration file and restart the server. If you change the server's secret key make sure to modify AIStore proxy configuration as well.

At start AuthN checks user list. If it is empty, AuthN creates a default user that can access to everything: user ID is `admin` and password is `admin`. Do not forget to change the user's password for security reasons.

### Notation

> `PROXY` - (hostname:port) of a **gateway**(any gateway in a given AIS cluster)

### AuthN configuration and log

| File                 | Location                     |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Server configuration | `$AUTHN_CONF_DIR/authn.json` |
| User database        | `$AUTHN_CONF_DIR/authn.db`   |
| Log directory        | `$AIS_LOG_DIR/authn/log/`    |

### How to enable AuthN server after deployment

By default, AIStore deployment currently won't launch the AuthN server. To start AuthN, perform the following steps:

- Change AIStore proxy configuration to enable token-based access: look for `{"auth": { "enabled": false } }` in proxy configuration file and replace `false` with `true`. Restart the proxy to apply changes
- Start authn server: <path_to_ais_binaries>/authn -config=<path_to_config_dir>/authn.json. Path to config directory is set at the time of cluster deployment and it is the same as the directory for AIStore proxies and targets

### Using Kubernetes secrets

To increase security, secret key for token generation can be
put to [Kubernetes secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)
instead of keeping them in an AuthN configuration file. When secrets are used, AuthN
overrides configuration values with environment variables set by Kubernetes.

Add secrets to AuthN pod description:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secret-env-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container-name
        image: image-name
        env:
          - name: SECRETKEY
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: mysecret
                key: secret-key
```

In the example above the values in all-capitals are the names of the environment
variables that AuthN looks for. All other values are arbitrary.

When AuthN pod starts, it loads its configuration from local file, and then
overrides secret values with ones from the pod's description.

## Rest API

### Notation

> `AUTHSRV` - denotes a (hostname:port) address of AuthN server

### Authorization

After deploying the cluster, a superuser role `Admin` and `admin` account are created automatically.
Only users with `Admin` role can manage AuthN. Every request to AuthN(except login one) must
contain authentication token in the header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token-issued-by-AuthN-after-login>
```

For curl, it is an extra argument `-H 'Authorization: Bearer token'`.

### Tokens

AIStore proxies and targets require a valid token in a request header - but only if AuthN is enabled. Every token includes all the information needed by the target:

A token is validated by a proxy. The token must not be expired and it must not be in the blacklist. The blacklist is a list of revoked tokens.
The list of revoked tokens is broadcast over the registered clusters on change. Periodically the list is cleaned up by removing expired tokens.

- UserID (username)
- User ACL
- Time when the token expires

Generating a token for data access does not require a token. Users must provide correct usernames and passwords to get their tokens.
Token has expiration time that is 24 hours by default. To change default expiration time, look for `expiration_time` in the configuration file.

A generated token is returned as a JSON formatted message. Example: `{"token": "issued_token"}`.

Call revoke token API to forcefully invalidate a token before it expires.

| Operation | HTTP Action | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Generate a token for a user (Log in) | POST {"password": "pass"} /v1/users/username | curl -X POST AUTHSRV/v1/users/username -d '{"password":"pass"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' |
| Revoke a token (Log out) | DEL { "token": "issued_token" } /v1/tokens | curl -X DEL AUTHSRV/v1/tokens -d '{"token":"issued_token"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' |

### Clusters

When a cluster is registered, an arbitrary alias can be assigned for the cluster. The alias is used to make role names and CLI commands more user-friendly. Internally, the alias is used to create default roles for a just registered cluster. If a cluster does not have an alias, the roles contain the cluster's ID.

| Operation | HTTP Action | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Get a list of registered clusters | GET /v1/clusters | curl -X GET AUTHSRV/v1/clusters |
| Get a registered cluster info | GET /v1/clusters/cluster-id | curl -X GET AUTHSRV/v1/clusters/cluster-id |
| Register a cluster | POST /v1/clusters {"id": "cluster-id", "alias": "cluster-alias", "urls": ["http://CLUSTERIP:PORT"]}| curl -X POST AUTHSRV/v1/clusters -d '{"id": "cluster-id", "alias": "cluster-alias", "urls": ["http://CLUSTERIP:PORT"]}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' |
| Update a registered cluster | PUT /v1/clusters/id {"alias": "cluster-alias", "urls": ["http://CLUSTERIP:PORT"]}| curl -X PUT AUTHSRV/v1/clusters/id -d '{"alias": "cluster-alias", "urls": ["http://CLUSTERIP:PORT"]}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' |
| Delete a registered cluster | DELETE /v1/clusters/cluster-id | curl -X DELETE AUTHSRV/v1/clusters/cluster-id |

### Roles

| Operation | HTTP Action | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Get a list of roles | GET /v1/roles | curl -X GET AUTHSRV/v1/roles |
| Create a new roles | POST /v1/roles {"name": "rolename", "desc": "description", "clusters": ["clusterid": permissions]} | curl -X AUTHSRV/v1/roles '{"name": "rolename", "desc": "description", "clusters": ["clusterid": permissions]}' |
| Update an existing roles | PUT /v1/roles/role-name {"desc": "description", "clusters": ["clusterid": permissions]} | curl -X PUT AUTHSRV/v1/roles '{"desc": "description", "clusters": ["clusterid": permissions]}' |
| Delete a role | DELETE /v1/roles/role-name | curl -X DELETE AUTHSRV/v1/roles/role-name |

### Users

| Operation | HTTP Action | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Get a list of users | GET /v1/users | curl -X GET AUTHSRV/v1/users |
| Add a user| POST {"id": "username", "password": "pass", "roles": ["CluOne-owner", "CluTwo-readonly"]} /v1/users | curl -X POST AUTHSRV/v1/users -d '{"id": "username", "password":"pass", "roles": ["CluOne-owner", "CluTwo-readonly"]}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' |
| Update an existing user| PUT {"password": "pass", "roles": ["CluOne-owner", "CluTwo-readonly"]} /v1/users/user-id | curl -X PUT AUTHSRV/v1/users/user-id -d '{"password":"pass", "roles": ["CluOne-owner", "CluTwo-readonly"]}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' |
| Delete a user | DELETE /v1/users/username | curl -X DELETE AUTHSRV/v1/users/username |

## AuthN server typical workflow

If the AuthN server is enabled then all requests to buckets and objects should contain a valid token issued by AuthN. Requests without a token are rejected.

Steps to generate and use a token:

1. Superuser creates a user account

```console
$ curl -X POST http://AUTHSRV/v1/users \
  -d '{"name": "username", "password": "pass"}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -uadmin:admin
```

2. The user requests a token

```console
$ curl -X POST http://AUTHSRV/v1/users/username \
  -d '{"password": "pass"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

{"token": "eyJhbGciOiJI.eyJjcmVkcyI.T6r6790"}
```
3. The user adds the token for every AIStore request (list buckets names example)

```console
$ curl -L  http://PROXY/v1/buckets/* -X GET \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJI.eyJjcmVkcyI.T6r6790"

{
  "cloud": [ "image-net-set-1" ],
  "ais": [ "train-set-001", "train-set-002" ]
}
```

## Known limitations

- **Per-bucket authentication**. It is currently not possible to limit user access to only a certain bucket, or buckets. Once users with read-write access log in, they have full access to all cluster's buckets.
