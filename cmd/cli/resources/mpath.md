# Mountpath (disk) management

A *mountpath* is a single disk **or** a volume (a RAID) formatted with a local filesystem of choice, **and** a local directory that AIS utilizes to store user data and AIS metadata. A mountpath can be disabled and (re)enabled, automatically or administratively, at any point during runtime. In a given cluster, a total number of mountpaths would normally compute as a direct product of (number of storage targets) x (number of disks in each target).

## Attach mountpath

`ais attach mountpath DAEMON_ID=MOUNTPATH [DAEMONID=MOUNTPATH...]`

Attach a mountpath on a specified target to AIS storage.

### Examples

```console
$ ais attach mountpath 12367t8080=/data/dir
```

## Detach mountpath

`ais detach mountpath DAEMON_ID=MOUNTPATH [DAEMONID=MOUNTPATH...]`

Detach a mountpath on a specified target from AIS storage.

### Examples

```console
$ ais detach mountpath 12367t8080=/data/dir
```
