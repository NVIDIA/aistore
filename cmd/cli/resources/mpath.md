# CLI Reference for Mountpath (disk) management
This section lists mountpath management operations the AIS CLI, with `ais mountpath`.

A *mountpath* is a single disk **or** a volume (a RAID) formatted with a local filesystem of choice, **and** a local directory that AIS utilizes to store user data and AIS metadata. A mountpath can be disabled and (re)enabled, automatically or administratively, at any point during runtime. In a given cluster, a total number of mountpaths would normally compute as a direct product of (number of storage targets) x (number of disks in each target).

## Show mountpaths

`ais mountpath show [DAEMON_ID]`

> Note: Like many other `ais show` commands, `ais show mountpath` is aliased to `ais mountpath show` for ease of use.
> Both of these commands are used interchangeably throughout the documentation.
