Sometimes a node has to be removed from a cluster - either temporarily (e.g., to perform maintenance tasks) or permanently. It is then important to do the "removal" gracefully, via provided AIS APIs. In particular, if the node is a storage target, it'll contain user data that must be *rebalanced* to remaining clustered nodes.

Two kinds of node removal are supported:

- temporary removal, e.g. for node maintenance. In this case the node remains in the cluster but it stops responding client requests;
- permanent removal, e.g. node decommission. This operation disables a node, and starts moving all its objects to other targets. When rebalance finishes, the primary proxy automatically removes the node from the cluster.

### Putting a node in maintenance

<img src="docs/images/maintenance.png" alt="Put a node under maintenance">

To take a node out of the cluster temporary while keeping it in the cluster list, put a node under maintenance (CLI):

```console
$ ais rm node 59262t8087 --mode=start-maintenance
Node "59262t8087" is under maintenance
Started rebalance "g1", use 'ais show xaction g1' to monitor progress
```

If the node is a target, after a quick preparation, the cluster starts rebalance. When the rebalance finishes, it is safe to turn the node off.

If the node does not contain any important data, rebalance can be skipped, so the node is safe to switch off in a short time after putting it under maintenance:

```console
$ ais rm node 59262t8087 --mode=start-maintenance --no-rebalance
Node "59262t8087" is under maintenance
```

#### Stopping node maintenance

When maintenance is finished, you should notify the cluster that the node is ready to use.
After getting the notification, the cluster clears maintenance state and starts rebalance:

```console
$ ais rm node 59262t8087 --mode=stop-maintenance
Node "59262t8087" maintenance stopped
Started rebalance "g3", use 'ais show xaction g3' to monitor progress
```

To skip automatic rebalance, provide flag `--no-rebalance`.
It is recommended to keep automatic rebalance running automatically, but in some cases it is safe to skip it:

- all buckets are empty
- maintenance was started with `--no-rebalance` and no object was added or updated during maintenance
- objects can be refetched from remote sources. E.g, all buckets are remote AIS, HTTP or Cloud ones. In this case targets redownload missing objects. That can cost extra money for traffic to Cloud
- you are going to stop maintenance for more than 1 node. So, all nodes except the last one are back to the cluster with flag `--no-rebalance`, and the last node starts the automatic rebalance

### Removing a node from a cluster

To completely remove the node from the cluster, start the node decommissioning (CLI):

```console
$ ais rm node 59262t8087 --mode=decommission
Node "59262t8087" is under maintenance
Started rebalance "g1", use 'ais show xaction g1' to monitor progress
```

When the rebalance finishes, the cluster removes the node automatically from the list.
Disabling rebalance runs quick preparations and removes the node from the cluster immediately:

```console
$ ais rm node 59262t8087 --mode=decommission --no-rebalance
Node "59262t8087" removed from the cluster
```

Note that removing a node with rebalance disabled can be interrupted. If a node is removed by mistake, you have to join it manually with `ais join` command.

### Interrupt node removal

While rebalance is running, the removal operation can be interrupted to get the node back to the cluster.
Rebalance starts automatically when a node is a target and flag `--no-rebalance` is not set after the node is registered at the cluster and the cluster clears node's maintenance state.

```console
$ ais rm node 59262t8087 --mode=stop-maintenance
Node "59262t8087" maintenance stopped
Started rebalance "g3", use 'ais show xaction g3' to monitor progress
```

The node starts accepting all the requests after joining the cluster and after the cluster clears node's maintenance state. You do not have to wait until the rebalance is done.

### Checking removal status

Putting a node under maintenance does not do anything automatically after the rebalance finishes. Check the cluster health to be sure that it is safe to turn the node off. Besides checking xaction progress, the removal status can be monitored with `ais cluster status` command.

In the example below it is safe to turn off the node (the column `REBALANCE` states that the rebalance has already finished and the node is labeled `maintenance`):

```console
$ ais show cluster target
TARGET           MEM USED %      MEM AVAIL       CAP USED %      CAP AVAIL       CPU USED %      REBALANCE               UPTIME  STATUS
59262t8087       0.13            31.28GiB        16              2.435TiB        0.00            finished; 0 moved (0B)  31m     maintenance
93683t8084       0.13            31.28GiB        16              2.435TiB        0.12            finished; 0 moved (0B)  31m     healthy
```

For decommissioning nodes, the status looks this while the rebalance is running:

```console
$ ais show cluster target
TARGET           MEM USED %      MEM AVAIL       CAP USED %      CAP AVAIL       CPU USED %      REBALANCE               UPTIME  STATUS
59262t8087       0.13            31.28GiB        16              2.435TiB        0.00            running; 0 moved (0B)   31m     decommission
93683t8084       0.13            31.28GiB        16              2.435TiB        0.12            running; 0 moved (0B)   31m     healthy
```

On finishing the rebalance, the primary proxy removes the node automatically:

```console
$ ais show cluster target
TARGET           MEM USED %      MEM AVAIL       CAP USED %      CAP AVAIL       CPU USED %      REBALANCE               UPTIME  STATUS
93683t8084       0.13            31.28GiB        16              2.435TiB        0.12            running; 0 moved (0B)   31m     healthy
```
