**ETL** stands for **E**xtract, **T**ransform, **L**oad. More specifically:

* **E**xtract - data from different original formats and/or multiple sources;
* **T**ransform - to the unified common format optimized for subsequent computation (e.g., training deep learning model);
* **L**oad - transformed data into a new destination - e.g., a storage system that supports high-performance computing over large scale datasets.

The latter can be AIStore (AIS). The system is designed from the ground up to support all 3 stages of the ETL pre (or post) processing. You can easily task the AIS cluster by running custom transformations:

* *inline* - that is, transforming datasets on the fly by (randomly) reading them and streaming a resulting transformed output directly to (computing) clients that perform those reads;
* *offline* - storing transformed output as a new dataset that AIStore will make available for any number of future computations.

> Implementation-wise, *offline* transformations of any kind, on the one hand, and copying datasets, on the other, are closely related - the latter being, effectively, a *no-op* offline transformation.

Most notably, AIS always runs transformations locally - *close to data*. Running *close to data* has always been one of the cornerstone design principles whereby in a deployed cluster each AIStore target proportionally contributes to the resulting cumulative bandwidth - the bandwidth that, in turn, will scale linearly with each added target.

This was the principle behind *distributed shuffle* (code-named [dSort](/docs/dsort.md)).
And this is exactly how we have more recently implemented **AIS-ETL** - the ETL service provided by AIStore.

Technically, the service supports running user-provided ETL containers **and** custom Python scripts *in the* (and *by the*) storage cluster.

**Note:** AIS-ETL (service) requires [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

## Getting Started

The following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PHkqTSE0ls "AIStore ETL Getting Started (Youtube video)") demonstrates AIStore's ETL feature using Jupyter Notebook.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="4PHkqTSE0ls" %}

## Inline ETL example

![etl-md5](images/etl-md5.gif)

The example above uses [AIS CLI](/docs/cli.md) to:
1. **Create** a new bucket;
2. **PUT** an object into this bucket;
3. **Init** ETL container that performs MD5 computation.
4. **Transform** the object on the fly via custom ETL - the "transformation" in this case boils down to computing the object's MD5.
5. **Compare** the output with locally computed MD5.

Note that both the container itself and its [YAML specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/ais-etl/master/transformers/md5/pod.yaml) (below) are included primarily for illustration purposes.

* [MD5 ETL YAML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/ais-etl/master/transformers/md5/pod.yaml)

## Offline ETL example

![etl-imagenet](images/etl-imagenet.gif)

The example above uses [AIS CLI](/docs/cli.md) to:
1. **Create** a new AIS bucket;
2. **PUT** multiple TAR files containing ImageNet images into the created bucket;
3. **Init** ETL container-based only on a simple python function;
4. **Transform** offline each TAR from the source bucket by standardizing images from the TAR and putting results in a destination bucket;
5. **Verify** the transformation output by downloading one of the transformed TARs and checking its content.

## Kubernetes Deployment

> If you already have a running AIStore cluster deployed on Kubernetes, skip this section and go to the [Initialize ETL](#defining-and-initializing-etl) section.

To deploy the ETL-ready AIStore cluster, please refer to [Getting Started](getting_started.md).

> Note that you have to choose one of the deployment types that supports Kubernetes - for example, [Cloud Deployment](getting_started.md#cloud-deployment).

> During the AIStore on Kubernetes deployment, the `HOSTNAME` environment variable, set by Kubernetes, **shouldn't** be overwritten - AIS target uses it to discover its Pod and Node name.

To verify that your deployment is set up correctly, run the following [CLI](/docs/cli.md) command:
```console
$ ais etl ls
```

If you see an empty response (and no errors) - your AIStore cluster is ready to run ETL.

To deploy AIStore on Minkube, see:

- [Deploying AIStore on Minikube](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/tree/master/deploy/dev/k8s#developing-aistore-on-minikube)


## Extract, Transform and Load using user-defined functions

1. Send transform function in the [**init code** request](#init-code-request) to an AIStore endpoint
2. Upon receiving the **init code** request, the AIS proxy broadcasts the request to all AIS targets in the cluster.
3. When an AIS target receives **init code**, it starts the container **locally** on the target's machine (aka [Kubernetes Node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/)).

## Extract, Transform and Load using custom containers

1. execute [**init spec** API](#init-spec-request) to an AIStore endpoint.
   >  The request carries YAML spec and ultimately triggers creating [Kubernetes Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/) that run the user's ETL logic inside.
2. Upon receiving the **init spec** request, the AIS proxy broadcasts the request to all AIS targets in the cluster.
3. When a target receives **init spec**, it starts the user container **locally** on the target's machine (aka [Kubernetes Node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/)).

## *init code* request

You can write your custom `transform` function that takes input object bytes as a parameter and returns output bytes (the transformed object's content).
You can then use the *init code* request to execute this `transform` on the entire distributed dataset.

In effect, a user can skip the entire step of writing their Dockerfile and building a custom ETL container - the *init code* capability allows the user to skip this step entirely.

> If you are familiar with [FasS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_as_a_service), then you probably will find this type of ETL initialization the most intuitive.

For a detailed step-by-step tutorial on *init code* requests, please see [Python SDK ETL Tutorial](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/python/aistore/examples/sdk/sdk-etl-tutorial.ipynb) and [Python SDK ETL Examples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/tree/master/python/aistore/examples/ais-etl).

The `init_code` request currently supports two communication types:

### `hpush://` communication

In `hpush` communication type, the user has to define a function that takes bytes as a parameter, processes it and returns bytes. e.g. [ETL to calculate MD5 of an object](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/python/aistore/examples/ais-etl/etl_md5_hpush.py)

```python
def transform(input_bytes: bytes) -> bytes
```

We realize that sometimes the transformation function is not that straightforward, and you might need some initialization prior to the function as well post the function. For that, we have included `before(context)` and `after(context)` functions in python runtime for AIS-ETL.

```python
def before(context: Dict[str, object]) -> None

def transform(input_bytes: bytes) -> Union[bytes, None]

def after(context: Dict[str, object]) -> bytes
```

You can also stream objects in `transform()` by setting the `CHUNK_SIZE` parameter (`CHUNK_SIZE` > 0).

e.g. [ETL to calculate MD5 of an object with streaming](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/python/aistore/examples/ais-etl/etl_md5_hpush.py), [ETL to transform images using torchvision](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/python/aistore/examples/ais-etl/etl_torchvision_hpush.py).

> **Note:**
>- `before(context)` and `after(context)` functions are optional and not always needed.
>- If your `transform()` function uses streaming (`CHUNK_SIZE`> 0), and has no `after(context)` function to consolidate result, please add the result into `context["result"]`.
>- If the function uses external dependencies, a user can provide an optional dependencies file or in the `elt().init()` function of Python SDK. These requirements will be installed on the machine executing the `transform` function and will be available for the function.

### `io://` communication

In `io://` communication type, users have to define a `transform()` function that reads bytes from [`sys.stdin`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stdin), carries out transformations over it, and then writes bytes to [`sys.stdout`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stdout).

```python
def transform() -> None:
    input_bytes = sys.stdin.buffer.read()
    # output_bytes = process(input_bytes)
    sys.stdout.buffer.write(output_bytes)
```

e.g. [ETL to calculate MD5 of an object](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/python/aistore/examples/ais-etl/etl_md5_io.py), [ETL to transform images using torchvision](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/python/aistore/examples/ais-etl/etl_torchvision_io.py)

### Runtimes

AIS-ETL provides several *runtimes* out of the box.
Each *runtime* determines the programming language of your custom `transform` function and the set of pre-installed packages and tools that your `transform` can utilize.

Currently, the following runtimes are supported:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `python3.8v2` | `python:3.8` is used to run the code. |
| `python3.10v2` | `python:3.10` is used to run the code. |
| `python3.11v2` | `python:3.11` is used to run the code. |

More *runtimes* will be added in the future, with plans to support the most popular ETL toolchains.
Still, since the number of supported  *runtimes* will always remain somewhat limited, there's always the second way: build your ETL container and deploy it via [*init spec* request](#init-spec-request).

## *init spec* request

*Init spec* request covers all, even the most sophisticated, cases of ETL initialization.
It allows running any Docker image that implements certain requirements on communication with the cluster.
The *init spec* request requires writing a Pod specification following specification requirements.

For a detailed step-by-step tutorial on *init spec* request, please see the [MD5 ETL playbook](/docs/tutorials/etl/compute_md5.md).

#### Requirements

Custom ETL container is expected to satisfy the following requirements:

1. Start a web server that supports at least one of the listed [communication mechanisms](#communication-mechanisms).
2. The server can listen on any port, but the port must be specified in Pod spec with `containerPort` - the cluster
 must know how to contact the Pod.
3. AIS target(s) may send requests in parallel to the web server inside the ETL container - any synchronization, therefore, must be done on the server-side.

#### Specification YAML

Specification of an ETL should be in the form of a YAML file.
It is required to follow the Kubernetes [Pod template format](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#pod-templates)
and contain all necessary fields to start the Pod.

#### Required or additional fields

| Path | Required | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `metadata.annotations.communication_type` | `false` | [Communication type](#communication-mechanisms) of an ETL. | `hpush://` |
| `metadata.annotations.wait_timeout` | `false` | Timeout on ETL Pods starting on target machines. See [annotations](#annotations) | infinity |
| `spec.containers` | `true` | Containers running inside a Pod, exactly one required. | - |
| `spec.containers[0].image` | `true` | Docker image of ETL container. | - |
| `spec.containers[0].ports` | `true` (except `io://` communication type) | Ports exposed by a container, at least one expected. | - |
| `spec.containers[0].ports[0].Name` | `true` | Name of the first Pod should be `default`. | - |
| `spec.containers[0].ports[0].containerPort` | `true` | Port which a cluster will contact containers on. | - |
| `spec.containers[0].readinessProbe` | `true` (except `io://` communication type) | ReadinessProbe of a container. | - |
| `spec.containers[0].readinessProbe.timeoutSeconds` | `false` | Timeout for a readiness probe in seconds. | `5` |
| `spec.containers[0].readinessProbe.periodSeconds` | `false` | Period between readiness probe requests in seconds. | `10` |
| `spec.containers[0].readinessProbe.httpGet.Path` | `true` | Path for HTTP readiness probes. | - |
| `spec.containers[0].readinessProbe.httpGet.Port` | `true` | Port for HTTP readiness probes. Required `default`. | - |

#### Forbidden fields

| Path | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `spec.affinity.nodeAffinity` | Used by AIStore to colocate ETL containers with targets. |

#### Communication Mechanisms

AIS currently supports 3 (three) distinct target ⇔ container communication mechanisms to facilitate the fly or offline transformation.
Users  can choose and specify (via YAML spec) any of the following:

| Name | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **post** | `hpush://` | A target issues a POST request to its ETL container with the body containing the requested object. After finishing the request, the target forwards the response from the ETL container to the user. |
| **reverse proxy** | `hrev://` | A target uses a [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) to send a (GET) request to a cluster using an ETL container. ETL container should make a GET request to a target, transform bytes, and return the result to the target. |
| **redirect** | `hpull://` | A target uses [HTTP redirect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Redirections) to send a (GET) request to cluster using an ETL container. ETL container should make a GET request to the target, transform bytes, and return it to a user. |
| **input/output** | `io://` | A target remotely runs the binary or the code and sends the data to standard input and excepts the transformed bytes to be sent on standard output. |

> ETL container will have `AIS_TARGET_URL` environment variable set to the URL of its corresponding target.
> To make a request for a given object it is required to add `<bucket-name>/<object-name>` to `AIS_TARGET_URL`, eg. `requests.get(env("AIS_TARGET_URL") + "/" + bucket_name + "/" + object_name)`.

## Transforming objects

AIStore supports both *inline* transformation of selected objects and *offline* transformation of an entire bucket.

There are two ways to run ETL transformations:
- HTTP RESTful APIs are described in [API Reference section](#api-reference) of this document,
- [ETL CLI](/docs/cli/etl.md),
- [AIS Loader](/docs/aisloader.md).

## API Reference

This section describes how to interact with ETLs via RESTful API.

> `G` - denotes a (`hostname:port`) address of a **gateway** (any gateway in a given AIS cluster)

| Operation | Description | HTTP action | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Delete ETL | Delete ETL spec/code with given `ETL_ID` | DELETE /v1/etl/<ETL_ID> | `curl -X DELETE 'http://G/v1/etl/ETL_ID' |


## ETL name specifications

Every initialized ETL has a unique user-defined `ETL_ID` associated with it, used for running transforms/computation on data or stopping the ETL.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: compute-md5
(...)
```

When initializing ETL from spec/code, a valid and unique user-defined `ETL_ID` should be assigned using the `--name` CLI parameter as shown below.

```console
$ ais etl init code --name=etl-md5 --from-file=code.py --runtime=python3 --deps-file=deps.txt
or
$ ais etl init spec --name=etl-md5 --from-file=spec.yaml
```

Below are specifications for a valid `ETL_ID`:
1. Starts with an alphabet 'A' to 'Z' or 'a' to 'z'.
2. Can contain alphabets, numbers, underscore ('_'), or hyphen ('-').
3. Should have a length greater than 5 and less than 21.
4. Shouldn't contain special characters, except for underscore and hyphen.
