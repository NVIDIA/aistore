# Performance tuning

Articles you may find useful:
* [Ubuntu Performance Tuning (archived)](https://web.archive.org/web/20190811180754/https://wiki.mikejung.biz/Ubuntu_Performance_Tuning) <- good guide about general optimizations (some of them are described below)
* [RHEL 7 Performance Tuning Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/pdf/performance_tuning_guide/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux-7-Performance_Tuning_Guide-en-US.pdf) <- detailed view on how to tune the RHEL lot of the tips and tricks apply for other Linux distributions

## CPU

Setting CPU governor (P-States) to `performance` may make a big difference and, in particular, result in much better network throughput:

* [Recent Linux TCP Updates, and how to tune your 100G host](https://fasterdata.es.net/assets/Papers-and-Publications/100G-Tuning-TechEx2016.tierney.pdf) (slide 13)

On `Linux`:

```console
$ echo performance | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

or using `cpupower` package (on `Debian` and `Ubuntu`):

```console
$ apt-get install -y linux-tools-$(uname -r) # install `cpupower`
$ cpupower frequency-info # check current settings
$ cpupower frequency-set -r -g performance # set `performance` setting to all CPU's
$ cpupower frequency-info # check settings after the change
```

Once the packages are installed (the step that will depend on your Linux distribution), you can then follow the *tuning instructions* from the referenced PDF (above).

## Network

* MTU should be set to `9000` (Jumbo frames) - this is one of the most important configurations
* Optimize TCP send buffer sizes on the target side (`net.core.rmem_max`, `net.ipv4.tcp_rmem`)
* Optimize TCP receive buffer on the client (reading) side (`net.core.wmem_max`, `net.ipv4.tcp_wmem`)
* `net.ipv4.tcp_mtu_probing = 2` # especially important in communication between client <-> proxy or client <-> target and if client has `mtu` set > 1500
* Wait.. there is more: [all ip-sysctl configurations](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/ip-sysctl)

### Smoke test

To ensure client ⇔ proxy, client ⇔ target, proxy ⇔ target, and target ⇔ target connectivity you can use `iperf` (make sure to use Jumbo frames and disable fragmentation).
Here is example use of `iperf`:

```console
$ iperf -P 20 -l 128K -i 1 -t 30 -w 512K -c <IP-address>
```

**NOTE**: `iperf` must show 95% of the bandwidth of a given phys interface. If it does not, try to find out why. It might have no sense to run any benchmark prior to finding out.

### Maximum open files

To ensure that AIStore works properly you probably need to increase the default number of open files. To check the current settings, you can use `ulimit -n`.

> It is strongly recommended to raise ulimit to at least `100,000`.

Here're the (example) settings that we use for development:

```
$ tail /etc/security/limits.conf
#ftp             hard    nproc           0
#ftp             -       chroot          /ftp
#@student        -       maxlogins       4

root             hard    nofile          999999
root             soft    nofile          999999
ubuntu           hard    nofile          999999
ubuntu           soft    nofile          999999

# End of file
```

> If the change in the ` /etc/security/limits.conf` (above) does not cause `ulimit -n` to show expected numbers, try then modifying `/etc/systemd/user.conf` and `/etc/systemd/system.conf`. In both configurations files, look for the line `#DefaultLimitNOFILE=` and uncomment it as `DefaultLimitNOFILE=999999`. A brief discussion of the topic can be found [here](https://superuser.com/questions/1200539/cannot-increase-open-file-limit-past-4096-ubuntu).

## Storage

Storage-wise, each local `ais_local.json` config must be looking as follows:

```json
{
    "net": {
        "hostname": "127.0.1.0",
        "port": "8080",
    },
    "fspaths": {
        "/tmp/ais/1": {},
        "/tmp/ais/2": {},
        "/tmp/ais/3": {}
    }
}
```

* Each local path from the `fspaths` section above must be (or contain as a prefix) a mountpoint of a local filesystem.
* Each local filesystem (above) must utilize one or more data drives, whereby none of the data drives is shared between two or more local filesystems.
* Each filesystem must be fine-tuned for reading large files/blocks/xfersizes.

### Disk priority

AIStore can be sensitive to spikes in I/O latencies, especially when running bursty traffic that carries large numbers of small-size I/O requests (resulting from writing and/or reading small-size objects).
To ensure that latencies do not spike because of some other processes running on the system it is recommended to give `aisnode` process the highest disk priority.
This can be done using [`ionice` tool](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ionice).

```console
$ # Best effort, highest priority
$ sudo ionice -c2 -n0 -p $(pgrep aisnode)
```

### Block settings

When initializing the disk it is necessary to set proper block size: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/disk-performance.html

```console
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<disk_name> bs=<block_size>
```

### Benchmarking disk

**TIP:** double check that rootfs/tmpfs of the AIStore target are _not_ used when reading and writing data.

When running a benchmark, make sure to run and collect the following in each and every target:

```console
$ iostat -cdxtm 10
```

Local hard drive read performance, the fastest block-level reading smoke test is:

```console
$ hdparm -Tt /dev/<drive-name>
```

Reading the block from certain offset (in gigabytes), `--direct` argument ensure that we bypass the drive’s buffer cache and read directly from the disk:

```console
$ hdparm -t --direct --offset 100 /dev/<drive-name>
```

More: [Tune hard disk with `hdparm`](http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/Tune-Your-Hard-Disk-with-hdparm).

### Underlying filesystem

Another way to increase storage performance is to benchmark different filesystems: `ext`, `xfs`, `openzfs`.
Tuning the IO scheduler can be a very important part of this process:
 * http://blackbird.si/tips-for-optimizing-disk-performance-on-linux/
 * https://cromwell-intl.com/open-source/performance-tuning/disks.html

It seems like generally `deadline` scheduler is a good choice for AIStore, instead of default `cfq`.
When you consider using `xfs` keep in mind that:

> According to xfs.org, the CFQ scheduler defeats much of the parallelization in XFS.

#### noatime

One of the most important performance improvements can be achieved by turning off `atime` (access time) updates on the filesystem.
This can be achieved by specifying `noatime` option when mounting the storage disk.

`atime` updates generate additional write traffic during file access (retrieving the object) which can significantly impact the overall throughput of the system.
Therefore, we **strongly** advise to use the `noatime` option when mounting a disk.

Important to note is that AIStore will still maintain access time updates but with using more optimized techniques as well as ensuring that it is consistent during object migration.

## Virtualization

AIStore node (proxy and target) must be deployed as a single VM on a given bare-metal host.
There must be no sharing of host resources between two or more VMs.
Even if there is a single VM, the host may decide to swap it out when idle, or give it a single hyperthreaded vCPU instead of a full-blown physical core - this condition must be prevented.
AIStore node needs to have a physical resource in its entirety: RAM, CPU, network, and storage. Hypervisor must resort to the remaining absolutely required minimum.
Make sure to use PCI passthrough to assign a device (NIC, HDD) directly to the AIStore node VM.

AIStore's primary goal is to scale with clustered drives. Therefore, the choice of a drive (type and capabilities) is very important.

## Metadata write policy

Sometimes it will make sense to keep storage system's metadata strictly in memory or, maybe, cache and flush it on a best-effort basis. The corresponding use cases include temporary datasets - transient data of any kind that can (and will) be discarded. There's also the case when AIS is used as a high-performance caching layer with original data already sufficiently replicated and protected.

Metadata write policy - json tag `md_write` - was introduced specifically to support those and related scenarios. Configurable both globally and for each individual bucket (or dataset), the current set of supported policies includes:

| Policy | Description |
| --- | ---|
| `immediate` | write immediately upon updates (global default) |
| `delayed`   | cache and flush when not accessed for a while (see also: [noatime](#noatime)) |
| `never`     | never write but always keep metadata in memory (aka "transient") |

> For the most recently updated enumeration, please see the [source](/cmn/api_const.go).

# AIS Loader

AIStore includes `aisloader` - a powerful tool that we use to simulate a variety of AI workloads. For numerous command-line options and usage examples, please see [Load Generator](/docs/aisloader.md) and [How To Benchmark AIStore](howto_benchmark.md). Or, just run the tool with empty command line and see its online help and examples.

> Note as well that `aisloader` is fully StatsD-enabled - the metrics can be formwarded to any StatsD-compliant backend for visualization and further analysis.
