While the preferred and recommended management client for AIStore is its own [CLI](/docs/cli.md), Amazon's [`s3cmd`](https://s3tools.org/s3cmd) client can also be used, with certain minor limitations.

But first:

## A quick example using `s3cmd` to operate on any buckets

AIStore is a multi-cloud mutli-backend solution: an AIS cluster can simultaneously access `ais://`, `s3://`, `gs://`, etc. buckets.

> For background on supported Cloud and non-Cloud backends, please see [Backend Providers](providers.md)

However:

When we use 3rd party clients, such as `s3cmd` and `aws`, we must impose a certain limitation: buckets in question must be unambiguously resolvable by name.

The following shows (native) `ais` and (Amazon's) `s3cmd` CLI that in many cases can be used interchangeably. There is a single bucket named `abc` and we access it using the two aforementioned clients.

But again, if we want to use `s3cmd` (or `aws`, etc.), there must be a **single `abc` bucket** across all providers.

> Notice that with `s3cmd` we must always use `s3://` prefix.

```console
$ ais ls ais:
$ ais bucket create ais://abc
"ais://abc" created (see https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/docs/bucket.md#default-bucket-properties)

$ ais bucket props set ais://abc checksum.type=md5
Bucket props successfully updated
"checksum.type" set to: "md5" (was: "xxhash")

$ s3cmd put README.md s3://abc
upload: 'README.md' -> 's3://abc/README.md'  [1 of 1]
 10689 of 10689   100% in    0s     3.13 MB/s  done
upload: 'README.md' -> 's3://abc/README.md'  [1 of 1]
 10689 of 10689   100% in    0s     4.20 MB/s  done

$ s3cmd rm s3://abc/README.md
delete: 's3://abc/README.md'
```

Similarly:

```console
$ ais ls s3:
aws://my-s3-bucket
...

$ s3cmd put README.md s3://my-s3-bucket
upload: 'README.md' -> 's3://my-s3-bucket/README.md'  [1 of 1]
 10689 of 10689   100% in    0s     3.13 MB/s  done
upload: 'README.md' -> 's3://abc/README.md'  [1 of 1]
 10689 of 10689   100% in    0s     4.20 MB/s  done

$ s3cmd rm s3://my-s3-bucket/README.md
delete: 's3://my-s3-bucket/README.md'
```

## `s3cmd` Configuration

When using `s3cmd` the very first time, **or** if your AWS access credentials have changed, **or** if you'd want to change certain `s3cmd` defaults (also shown below) - in each one and all of those cases run `s3cmd --configure`.

**NOTE:** it is important to have `s3cmd` client properly configured.

For example:

```console
# s3cmd --configure

Enter new values or accept defaults in brackets with Enter.
Refer to user manual for detailed description of all options.

Access key and Secret key are your identifiers for Amazon S3. Leave them empty for using the env variables.
Access Key [ABCDABCDABCDABCDABCD]: EFGHEFGHEFGHEFGHEFGH

Default Region [us-east-2]:

Use "s3.amazonaws.com" for S3 Endpoint and not modify it to the target Amazon S3.
S3 Endpoint [s3.amazonaws.com]:

Use "%(bucket)s.s3.amazonaws.com" to the target Amazon S3. "%(bucket)s" and "%(location)s" vars can be used
if the target S3 system supports dns based buckets.

```console
$ s3cmd --version
s3cmd version 2.0.1
```

## Getting Started

In this section we walk the most basic and simple (and simplified) steps to get `s3cmd` to conveniently work with AIStore.

### 1. AIS Endpoint

With `s3cmd` client configuration safely stored in `$HOME/.s3cfg`, the next immediate step is to figure out AIS endpoint

> AIS cluster must be running, of course.

The endpoint consists of a gateway's hostname and its port followed by `/s3` suffix.

> AIS clusters usually run multiple gateways all of which are equivalent in terms of supporting all operations and providing access (to their respective clusters).

For example: given AIS gateway at `10.10.0.1:51080` (where `51080` would be the gateway's listening port), AIS endpoint then would be `10.10.0.1:51080/s3`.

> **NOTE** the `/s3` suffix. It is important to have it in all subsequent `s3cmd` requests to AIS, and the surest way to achieve that is to have it in the endpoint.

### 2. How to have `s3cmd` calling AIS endpoint

But then the question is, how to transfer AIS endpoint into `s3cmd` commands. There are several ways; the one we show here is probably the easiest, exemplified by the `diff` below:

```sh
# diff -uN .s3cfg.orig $HOME/.s3cfg
--- .s3cfg.orig   2022-07-18 09:42:36.502271267 -0400
+++ .s3cfg        2022-07-18 10:14:50.878813029 -0400

 gpg_encrypt = %(gpg_command)s -c --verbose --no-use-agent --batch --yes --passphrase-fd %(passphrase_fd)s -o %(output_file)s %(input_file)s
 gpg_passphrase =
 guess_mime_type = True
-host_base = s3.amazonaws.com
-host_bucket = %(bucket)s.s3.amazonaws.com
+host_base = 10.10.0.1:51080/s3
+host_bucket = 10.10.0.1:51080/s3
 human_readable_sizes = False
 invalidate_default_index_on_cf = False
 invalidate_default_index_root_on_cf = True
```

Here we hack `s3cmd` configuration: replace Amazon's default `s3.amazonaws.com` endpoint with the correct one, and be done.

From this point on, `s3cmd` will be calling AIStore at 10.10.0.1:51080, with `/s3` suffix causing the latter to execute special handling (specifically) designed to support S3 compatibility.

### 3. Alternatively

Alternatively, instead of hacking `.s3cfg` once and for all we could use `--host` and `--host-bucket` command-line options (of the `s3cmd`). For instance:

```console
$ s3cmd put README.md s3://mmm/saved-readme.md --no-ssl --host=10.10.0.1:51080/s3 --host-bucket=10.10.0.1:51080/s3
```

> Compare with the identical `PUT` example [in the section 5 below](#5-create-bucket-and-putget-objects-using-s3cmd).

Goes without saying that, as long as `.s3cfg` keeps pointing to `s3.amazonaws.com`, the `--host` and `--host-bucket` must be explicitly specified in every `s3cmd` command.

### 4. Note and, possibly, update AIS configuration

This next step actually depends on the AIStore configuration - the configuration of the cluster we intend to use with `s3cmd` client.

Specifically, there are two config knobs of interest:

```console
# ais config cluster net.http.use_https
PROPERTY                 VALUE
net.http.use_https       false

# ais config cluster checksum.type
PROPERTY         VALUE
checksum.type    xxhash
```

Note that HTTPS is `s3cmd` default, and so if AIStore runs on HTTP every single `s3cmd` command must have the `--no-ssl` option.

> Setting `net.http.use_https=true` requires AIS cluster restart. In other words, HTTPS is configurable but for the HTTP => HTTPS change to take an effect AIS cluster must be restarted.

> **NOTE** `--no-ssl` flag, e.g.: `s3cmd ls --no-ssl` to list buckets.

```console
$ s3cmd ls --host=10.10.0.1:51080/s3
```

If the AIS cluster in question is deployed with HTTP (the default) and not HTTPS:

```console
$ ais config cluster net.http
PROPERTY                         VALUE
net.http.server_crt              server.crt
net.http.server_key              server.key
net.http.write_buffer_size       65536
net.http.read_buffer_size        65536
net.http.use_https               false # <<<<<<<<< (NOTE) <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
net.http.skip_verify             false
net.http.chunked_transfer        true
```

we need turn HTTPS off in the `s3cmd` client using its `--no-ssl` option.

For example:

```console
$ s3cmd ls --host=10.10.0.1:51080/s3 --no-ssl
```

Secondly, there's the second important knob mentioned above: `checksum.type=xxhash` (where `xxhash` is the AIS's default).

However:

When using `s3cmd` with AIStore, it is strongly recommended to update the checksum to `md5`.

The following will update checksum type globally, on the level of the entire cluster:

```console
# This update will cause all subsequently created buckets to use `md5`.
# But note: all existing buckets will keep using `xxhash`, as per their own - per-bucket - configuration.

$ ais config cluster checksum.type
PROPERTY         VALUE
checksum.type    xxhash

# ais config cluster checksum.type=md5
{
    "checksum.type": "md5"
}
```

Alternatively, and preferably, update specific bucket's property (e.g. `ais://nnn` below):

```console
$ ais bucket props set ais://nnn checksum.type=md5

Bucket props successfully updated
"checksum.type" set to: "md5" (was: "xxhash")
```

### 5. Create bucket and PUT/GET objects using `s3cmd`

Once the 3 steps (above) are done, the rest must be really easy. Just start using `s3cmd` as [described](https://s3tools.org/s3cmd-howto), for instance:

```console
# Create bucket `mmm` using `s3cmd` make-bucket (`mb`) command:
$ s3cmd mb s3://mmm --no-ssl
Bucket 's3://mmm/' created

# And double-check it using AIS CLI:
$ ais ls ais:
AIS Buckets (2)
  ais://mmm
  ...
```

Not to forget to change the bucket's checksum to `md5` (needed iff the default cluster-level checksum != `md5`):

```console
$ ais bucket props set ais://mmm checksum.type=md5
```

PUT:

```console
$ s3cmd put README.md s3://mmm/saved-readme.md --no-ssl
```

GET:

```console
$ s3cmd get s3://mmm/saved-readme.md /tmp/copied-readme.md --no-ssl
download: 's3://mmm/saved-readme.md -> '/tmp/copied-readme.md'  [1 of 1]
```

And so on.

### 6. Multipart upload using `s3cmd`

In this section, we use updated `.s3cfg` to avoid typing much longer command lines that contain `--host` and `--host-bucket` options.

In other words, we simplify `s3cmd` commands using the following local configuration update:

```diff
$ diff -uN ~/.s3cfg.orig ~/.s3cfg
--- /root/.s3cfg.orig
+++ /root/.s3cfg
@@ -31,6 +31,8 @@
 guess_mime_type = True
 host_base = s3.amazonaws.com
 host_bucket = %(bucket)s.s3.amazonaws.com
+host_base = localhost:8080/s3
+host_bucket = localhost:8080/s3
 human_readable_sizes = False
 invalidate_default_index_on_cf = False
 invalidate_default_index_root_on_cf = True
```

Goes without saying that `localhost:8080` (above) can be replaced with any legitimate (http or https) address of any AIS gateway.

The following further assumes that `abc` is an AIStore bucket, while `my-s3-bucket` is S3 bucket that _this_ AIStore cluster can access.

> The cluster must be deployed with [AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/v3/developer-guide/guide_credentials_profiles.html) to list, read, and write `my-s3-bucket`.

```console
# Upload 50MB aisnode executable in 5MB chunks
$ s3cmd put /go/bin/aisnode s3://abc --multipart-chunk-size-mb=5

# Notice the `ais://` prefix:
$ ais ls ais://abc
NAME      SIZE
aisnode   50.98MiB

# When using Amazon clients, we have to resort to always use s3://:
$ s3cmd ls s3://abc
2022-08-22 13:04  53452800   s3://abc/aisnode

# Confirm via `ls`:
$ ls -al /go/bin/aisnode
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 53452800 Aug 22 12:17 /root/gocode/bin/aisnode*
```

Uploading `s3://my-s3-bucket` looks absolutely identical with a one notable difference: consistently using `s3:` (or `aws://`) prefix:

```console
# Upload 50MB aisnode executable in 7MB chunks
$ s3cmd put /go/bin/aisnode s3://my-s3-bucket --multipart-chunk-size-mb=7

$ ais ls s3://my-s3-bucket
NAME      SIZE
aisnode   50.98MiB

$ s3cmd ls s3://my-s3-bucket
2022-08-22 13:04  53452800   s3://my-s3-bucket/aisnode
```

Use `s3cmd multipart` to show any/all ongoing uploads to `s3://my-s3-bucket` (or any other bucket):

```console
$ s3cmd multipart s3://my-s3-bucket
```

## S3 URI and Further References

Note that `s3cmd` expects S3 URI, simethin like `s3://bucket-name`.

In other words, `s3cmd` does not recognize any prefix other than `s3://`.

In the examples above, the `mmm` and `nnn` buckets are, actually, AIS buckets with no [remote backends](/docs/providers.md).

Nevertheless, when using `s3cmd` we have to reference them as `s3://mmm` and `s3://nnn`, respectively.
