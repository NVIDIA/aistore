AIStore will now aggregate not only disks (or, not just disks) but also directories. Any file directories – assuming, of course, they are not nested. Any number of regular file directories that, ostensibly, may not even have underlying block devices.

Here’s what has happened:

On the left and the right: an AIS cluster sandwiched between two interfaces often referred to as frontend and backend. Cluster provides the former (which inevitably entails [S3](/docs/s3compat.md) but not only), and utilizes the latter to perform fast-tiering function across vendors and solutions.

## TL;DR

Long story short, the upcoming v3.23 removes the requirement that every aistore mountpath is a separate filesystem (“FS” above) that owns a block device. In the past, this block device would have to present itself at a node’s startup and wouldn’t be permitted to be used by (or shared with) any other mountpath.

Not anymore, though. Planned for late April or May 2024, the release will introduce a separate indirection called “mountpath label.”
