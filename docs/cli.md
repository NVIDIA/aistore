AIS CLI (command-line interface) is intended to easily control and monitor every aspect of the AIS cluster life-cycle.
In addition, CLI provides dataset management commands, commands to read and write data, and more.

## Getting Started

To build CLI from source, run the following two steps:

```console
$ make cli			# 1. build CLI binary and install it into your `$GOPATH/bin` directory
$ make cli-autocompletions	# 2. install CLI autocompletions (Bash and/or Zsh)
```

Alternatively, install directly from GitHub:

* [Install CLI from release binaries](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/deploy/scripts/install_from_binaries.sh)

For example, the following command extracts CLI binary to the specified destination and, secondly, installs `bash` autocompletions:

```console
$ ./deploy/scripts/install_from_binaries.sh --dstdir /tmp/www --completions
```

For more usage options, run: `./deploy/scripts/install_from_binaries.sh --help`

You can also install `bash` and/or `zsh` autocompletions separately at any (later) time:

* [Install CLI autocompletions](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/cmd/cli/install_autocompletions.sh)

To uninstall autocompletions, follow the `install_autocompletions.sh` generated prompts, or simply run `bash autocomplete/uninstall.sh`.

**Please note**: using CLI with autocompletions enabled is strongly recommended.

Once installed, you should be able to start by running ais `<TAB-TAB>`, selecting one of the available (completion) options, and repeating until the command is ready to be entered.

**TL;DR**: see section [CLI reference](#cli-reference) below to quickly locate useful commands. There's also a (structured as a reference) list of CLI resources with numerous examples and usage guides that we constantly keep updating.

**TIP**: when starting with AIS, [`ais search`](/docs/cli/search.md) command may be especially handy. It will list all possible variations of a command you are maybe looking for - by exact match, synonym, or regex.

See also:

* [cmd/cli/README.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/cmd/cli/README.md)

> The rest of the README assumes that user's `PATH` environment variable contains `$GOPATH/bin` directory.
> Run `export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin` if this is not the case.
> You can find more about $GOPATH environment [here](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH).

Other CLI documentation:
- [Attach, Detach, and monitor remote clusters](/docs/cli/remote.md)
- [Start, Stop, and monitor downloads](/docs/cli/download.md)
- [Distributed Sort](/docs/cli/dsort.md)

> Note: In CLI docs, the terms "xaction" and "job" are used interchangeably.

## CLI Config

Notice:

* CLI configuration directory: `$HOME/.config/ais/cli`
* CLI configuration filename: `cli.json`

> For the most updated system filenames and configuration directories, please see [`fname/fname.go`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aistore/blob/master/cmn/fname/fname.go) source.


When used the very first time, *or* if the `$HOME/.config/ais/cli/cli.json` does not exist, the latter will be created with default parameters:

```json
{
  "cluster": {
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
    "default_ais_host": "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
    "default_docker_host": "http://172.50.0.2:8080",
    "skip_verify_crt": false
  },
  "timeout": {
    "tcp_timeout": "60s",
    "http_timeout": "0s"
  },
  "auth": {
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:52001"
  },
  "aliases": {
    "get": "object get",
    "ls": "bucket ls",
    "put": "object put"
  },
  "default_provider": "ais"
}
```

If you update config via `ais config cli set` command (or even simply change the config file) the next time CLI will use updated values.

## First steps

To get the list of supported commands, run:

```console
$ ais --help
```

> Alternatively, you could start making use of auto-completions by typing `ais ` and pressing TAB key two times in a row.

To check if the CLI can correctly contact the cluster and to get cluster status, run following command:

```console
$ ais show cluster
```

## Global options

Besides a set of options specific for each command, AIS CLI provides global options:

- `--no-color` - by default AIS CLI displays messages with colors (e.g, errors are printed in red color).
  Colors are automatically disabled if CLI output is redirected or environment variable `TERM=dumb` is set.
  To disable colors in other cases, pass `--no-color` to the application.

Please note that the place of a global options in the command line is fixed.
Global options must follow the application name directly.
At the same time, the location of a command-specific option is arbitrary: you can put them anywhere.
Examples:

```console
$ # Correct usage of global and command-specific options.
$ ais --no-color ls ais://bck --props all
$ ais --no-color ls --props all ais://bck
$
$ # Incorrect usage of a global option.
$ ais bucket ls ais://bck --props all --no-color
```

## Backend Provider

The syntax `provider://BUCKET_NAME` (referred to as `BUCKET` in help messages) works across all commands.
For more details, please refer to each specific command's documentation.
`provider://` can be omitted if the `default_provider` config value is set (in such case the config value will be used implicitly).

Supported backend providers currently include:
* `ais://` - AIStore provider
* `aws://` or `s3://` - Amazon Web Services
* `azure://` or `az://` - Azure Blob Storage
* `gcp://` or `gs://` - Google Cloud Storage
* `hdfs://` - HDFS Storage
* `ht://` - HTTP(S) datasets
