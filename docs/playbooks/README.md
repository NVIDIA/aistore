# Playbooks

A set of convenience playbooks to assist in running and using AIStore and its various extensions. The first topic we try to cover here is [ETL](/docs/etl.md#introduction), and specifically:

- [PyTorch ImageNet preprocessing](/docs/playbooks/etl/etl_imagenet_pytorch.md)
- [Compute MD5 of the object](/docs/playbooks/etl/compute_md5.md)

> See also: [Getting Started with AIS-ETL](/docs/etl.md)):
