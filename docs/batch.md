## List/Range Operations

AIStore provides two APIs to operate on groups of objects: List, and Template.

#### List

List APIs take a JSON array of object names, and initiate the operation on those objects.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| objnames | JSON array of object names |

#### Range

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| template | The object name template with optional range parts. If a range is omitted the template is used as an object name prefix |

#### Examples

All the following examples assume that the action is `delete` and the bucket name is `bck`, so only the value part of the request is shown:

`"value": {"list": "["obj1","dir/obj2"]"}` - deletes objects `obj1` and `dir/obj2` from the bucket `bck`

`"value": {"template": "obj-{07..10}"}` - removes the following objects from `bck`(note leading zeroes in object names):

- obj-07
- obj-08
- obj-09
- obj-10

`"value": {"template": "dir-{0..1}/obj-{07..08}"}` - template can contain more than one range, this example removes the following objects from `bck`(note leading zeroes in object names):

- dir-0/obj-07
- dir-0/obj-08
- dir-1/obj-07
- dir-1/obj-08

`"value": {"template": "dir-10/"}` - the template defines no ranges, so the request deletes all objects which names start with `dir-10/`
